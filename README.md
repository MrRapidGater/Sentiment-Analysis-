This project aims to implement sentiment analysis on 10000 tweets extracted from Twitter to deduce the sentiment of individuals during PSL (a sporting event popular in Pakistan). 
In order to achieve this, we conducted tokenization to analyze the text data. Please download the report that contains all the results if github can not open it.
